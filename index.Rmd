I am currently a clinical research coordinator at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. I serve as the lead clinical research coordinator on an NIMH-funded project utilizing behavioral economics, clinical psychology, and implementation science to improve the uptake of evidence-based practices for suicide prevention in primary care and specialty mental health settings. Additionally, I work on other projects that explore the effect of trauma exposure on clinical decision-making and treatment.

**My Research Interests:**

- Improving clinical outcomes in underserved and trauma-exposed individuals with psychopathology

- Factors that interfere with the effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for trauma-exposed populations

- Modifying existing interventions and treatments to improve uptake and clinical effectiveness among trauma-exposed populations

- mHealth, eHealth, and technology-assisted interventions that can be leveraged to improve access to evidence-based treatments and interventions
