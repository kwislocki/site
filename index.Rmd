I am currently a Doctoral Candidate in Clinical Psychology at the University of California, Irvine. I'm a mental health professional, researcher, and computer scientist (and sometimes all three at the same time!). My research focuses on the intersection of mental health and advanced technologies. I will be applying for clinical internship in 2026-2027.
